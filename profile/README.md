## Welcome to the Dapr-Sandbox org ðŸ‘‹

The Dapr-Sandbox org is where projects first start out being developed before moving to Dapr org as they mature. 
This is modelled on the CNCF [Project Maturity Levels](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) and the [CNCF Sandbox Graduation Criteria](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/sandbox.md).

Projects in this repo are not expected to be used in production scenarios. 

It is also possible for projects that are no longer being maintained in the Dapr org repo to be moved to the Dapr-Sandbox repo to indicate 
that these have returned to a experimental state.

If you have any questions on the status of projects in this repo either raise a question as an issue in this repo or post onto the Dapr Discord
general channel which you can find [here](https://github.com/dapr/community#questions-and-issues).
